its my cs bomber
There is a "Bomber" - the main character of the game. 
He has to get out of the maze and get to the door. 
There are only three levels of passage.
There are obstacles in the maze â€“ walls of blocks that break only thanks to a bomb (the main feature of the character is that he can place bombs on the field and blow them up). 
And there are villains who can be destroyed with bombs.
If you encounter a villain, he will kill you, and the player will lose, you will have to start the game from scratch. 
After passing to the door, the second level appears with a different arrangement of walls and villains. 
And so on until the end of the third level.
